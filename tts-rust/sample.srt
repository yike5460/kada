Hello everyone, I am Adil Islam

2
00:00:10,166 --> 00:00:11,666
the Chief of Staff at Stability AI

3
00:00:11,666 --> 00:00:18,366
my team collaborate with AWS on groundbreaking solutions including SageMaker and Bedrock

4
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:23,033
I'd like to take a moment to talk about one of our ongoing collaborative projects

5
00:00:23,033 --> 00:00:27,066
Stable Diffusion AWS Extension

6
00:00:27,066 --> 00:00:30,833
you can find on GitHub at the link shown on the screen

7
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:34,333
This project represents a leap forward in our collaboration

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,233
combining Stability's expertise in AI with AWS's robust cloud infrastructure

9
00:00:40,233 --> 00:00:47,333
users can migrate existing inference and training workload from standalone local client to AWS SageMaker

10
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:50,633
with optimized efficiency on scaling and cost

11
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:54,433
It's also helpful to promote Stable Diffusion to the broader open source community

12
00:00:54,433 --> 00:01:00,999
At Stability AI, we're helping to build an ecosystem where everyone can benefit from our advancements

13
00:01:00,999 --> 00:01:02,833
 thanks to open source

14
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:06,466
And we are grateful to have AWS as our partner at this journey

15
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:10,666
Looking ahead, we're excited about the potential for even deeper collaboration

16
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:18,266
One area we're particularly excited about is the integration of our new SDXL model with AWS SageMaker

17
00:01:18,266 --> 00:01:24,466
This integration will allow us to leverage the full power of AWS's machine learning capabilities

18
00:01:24,466 --> 00:01:28,833
opening up new possibilities for innovation and customer value

19
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:34,933
Finally, I want to express my deep gratitude to both the Stability AI and AWS teams

20
00:01:34,933 --> 00:01:41,300
Your hard work, dedication and creativity are what make this collaboration so successful

21
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,800
 Thank you for all that you do.
